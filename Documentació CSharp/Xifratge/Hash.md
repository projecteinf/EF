# Algoritmes de hash
| Algorithm | Hash size | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| MD5       | 16 bytes | This is commonly used because it is fast, but it is not collision-resistant |
| SHA1      | 20 bytes | The use of SHA1 on the internet has been deprecated since 2011 |
| SHA256    | 32 bytes | These are the Secure Hashing Algorithm 2nd generation (SHA2) algorithms with different hash sizes |
| SHA384    | 48 bytes | These are the Secure Hashing Algorithm 2nd generation (SHA2) algorithms with different hash sizes |
| SHA512    | 64 bytes | These are the Secure Hashing Algorithm 2nd generation (SHA2) algorithms with different hash sizes |
