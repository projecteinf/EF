# Web API
Web API is a concept or methodology for accessing any API (available over the web) through the HTTP protocol. There are many categories of APIs, SOAP, XML-RPC, JSON-RPC, REST, and so on. APIs can be developed with any programming language such as Java, .NET, and many more.  
# SOA
n short, SOA is essentially a collection of services, those services communicate with each other, and a service is an operation or a function that is well defined, self-contained, and independent of other service contexts and states. Services are applications hosted on application servers and interact with other applications through interfaces.  
SOA is not a technology or a programming language; it's a set of principles, procedures, and methodologies to develop a software application.
